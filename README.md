# Hey, I'm Antony

**MSc Computer Science with AI** student at St Mary's University, focused on machine learning and data science.

17 years in mechanical engineering taught me systematic problem-solving and debugging under pressure — skills that transfer directly to ML pipelines and data analysis.

## What I'm working with

- **AI/ML:** Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
- **Web:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase, PostgreSQL, SQL
- **Other:** Git, Arduino, Klipper, 3D Printing

## Current focus

- Deep Q-Learning and reinforcement learning
- Classical ML and neural network architectures
- Building end-to-end ML pipelines
- Ethical AI and responsible model development

## Featured projects
