# Hey, I'm Antony

Machine learning engineer and **MSc Computer Science with AI** student at St Mary's University.

17 years in mechanical engineering taught me systematic problem-solving and debugging under pressure — skills that transfer directly to ML pipelines and data analysis.

## What I'm working with

- **AI/ML:** Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
- **Web:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase, PostgreSQL, SQL
- **Other:** Git, Arduino, Klipper, 3D Printing

## Current focus

- Deep Q-Learning and reinforcement learning
- Classical ML and neural network architectures
- Building end-to-end ML pipelines
- Ethical AI and responsible model development

## Featured projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Snake RL](https://github.com/W17ant/msc-artificial-intelligence/tree/main/assessments/snake-rl) | Deep Q-Network agent with experience replay |
| [Heart Disease Classification](https://github.com/W17ant/msc-artificial-intelligence/tree/main/assessments/heart-disease) | Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Network comparison (85% accuracy) |
| [Portfolio](https://aoneill.co.uk) | Interactive experiments and ML project writeups |

## Looking for

Graduate roles in **AI/ML**, **Data Science**, or **Machine Learning Engineering**.
